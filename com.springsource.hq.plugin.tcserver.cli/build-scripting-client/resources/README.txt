tc Server Command-Line Interface
@BUNDLE_VERSION@


You have downloaded the tc Server command-line interface (CLI).  Use this CLI
to perform a subset of the tc Server configuration and application deployment 
tasks that you can perform using the Hyperic HQ user interface. You can use 
the CLI to configure and manage both a single tc Server instance or groups of 
tc Server instances.


How Do I Get Started?
---------------------

The script to execute the CLI is located in the bin directory. Depending on 
your operating system, the script is named tcsadmin.sh (Unix) or tcsadmin.bat 
(Windows). For more information, see the help docs in the CLI itself.

See also the tc Server Administration Guide for complete documentation about 
using the tcsadmin command-line interface:
